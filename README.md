# C language learning
This repository mainly consists of the programmes and experiences in my C language learning process. 
It is common to see some stupid mistakes here since I am a beginner in C language. 
If you find the problems, you can let me know or not - at your pleasure, but I would definately correct them as long as I realize the mistakes. 
Thanx for visiting my git and finish reading this passage.:)
